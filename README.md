# Interlace PDF files into a single PDF

This is a thin wrapper around the [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) package,
which I learned about from
[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Chapter 15](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter15/).

Formatted using [black](https://github.com/psf/black).
